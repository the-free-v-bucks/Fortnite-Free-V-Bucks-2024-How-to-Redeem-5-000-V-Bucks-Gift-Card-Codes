### What Are V-Bucks?

In Fortnite, **V-Bucks** (short for Vindertech Bucks) are the in-game currency used to purchase a variety of cosmetic items, including skins, emotes, back bling, pickaxes, and more. V-Bucks also play a crucial role in buying the **Battle Pass** each season, which unlocks additional rewards and challenges to keep the gameplay fresh.

As Fortnite continues to dominate the gaming world, V-Bucks have become a central part of the in-game economy, enabling players to personalize their characters and engage in more exciting experiences. However, buying V-Bucks often requires real money, and not all players want to spend their hard-earned cash on in-game purchases. Fortunately, thereâ€™s now a way to get V-Bucks **for free**.
